# Deep_Graph_Library_Tutorials
We go through steps in creating GNNs with DGL. 
We will cover the following topics. In each case, we implement the graph convolution layer (GCN, SageConv, GAT) from scratch and compare it with the built-in function from DGL.
1. GNN with GCN
2. GNN with GraphSage
3. Link prediction with GraphSage
4. Graph Classification
5. Graph Attention Network (GAT)
